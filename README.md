# Typing-Speed-Checker
Typing Speed Checker is a responsive web app that tracks typing speed and accuracy in real time. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a clean UI, error highlighting, and live WPM feedback. Designed for both desktop and mobile, it reflects my focus on usability, modularity, and frontend best practices.
